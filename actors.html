					Based on the sentiment analysis and community analysis conducted throughout this project, it is not possible to find enjoyable actor groups. The reason for this is both because of the way the communities are grouped, but also because of how sentiment analysis works.
					<br> 
					The communities are in general grouped by either country or time period. If one community had a higher sentiment score than other it would mean that for example movies with Indian actors, in general were better than movies with Japanese actors, and would therefore not say much about the specific actor groups.
					<br>
					The reason why sentiment analysis doesn't tell too much about which groups are the most enjoyable is that the sentiment score is heavily influenced by the general theme of the movies, instead of the actual critique of the movie. 
					This can be seen on the <a href="sentiment.html"> Sentiment </a> page, where the negative reviews are closely related to movies with a dark and heavy atmosphere and the positive reviews are related to happy movies.
					
					<br> 
					<br>
					Based on this project it can therefore be concluded that it is not possible to find enjoyable actor groups through this method.
